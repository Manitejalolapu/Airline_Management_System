# Airline_Management_System

The Airline Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage various airline operations efficiently. It includes modules for flight scheduling, reservations, and customer management. Users can search for flights, book tickets, select seats, and generate e-tickets. The system also manages customer profiles, frequent flyer programs, and provides real-time flight status updates. Built using core Java, it utilizes default inputs for initial data and simulates essential functions like payment processing and maintenance scheduling. This project aims to streamline airline operations, enhance customer experience, and improve overall efficiency without relying on external frameworks or databases.
